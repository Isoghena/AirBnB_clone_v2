AirBnB Clone - Web Framewor
----------------------------k
Overview
----------
The "AirBnB Clone - Web Framework" series(at this stage) is a web-based implementation of the AirBnB platform using the Flask web framework. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python, and it is used to build web applications in a simple and efficient manner. In this project, we leverage Flask's features to create a dynamic web application

Built With:
The project is built using the following technologies:

Flask: The web framework that forms the backbone of the application. Flask provides routing mechanisms, templating support, and handling of HTTP requests and responses.

Jinja2 Templating Engine: Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine that is integrated with Flask. It allows us to create dynamic HTML templates with placeholders that get filled with data from the backend.

SQLAlchemy ORM: SQLAlchemy is a popular Object-Relational Mapping library that enables us to interact with the database using Python objects and methods. It abstracts the database interactions and provides a higher-level, Pythonic interface.

MySQL Database: The project uses a MySQL database to store and manage the application's data, such as user information, cities, and states, reviews etc.

Flask:
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. You can design with it quickly, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.

Flask offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or project layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and libraries they want to use. There are many extensions provided by the community that make adding new functionality easy.
